Okay so, I made the thing in Mudlet itself and used the experimental package exporter to get the xml. Making changes should probably have the following work flow:

- Import package with the Package manager (Alt-O)
- Do teh thing! Tinker with it and try to keep things in the BackItUp folders
- Toolbox > Package Exporter
- Ensure you select all the relevant folders of triggers/aliases/scripts
- Unzip exported package for the xml file
- Add the xml file to the repository for version control
- _Draw a branch_, commit, and push!
- Make a pull request! :grin:
